      <description>Last night, I dreamt of Maggie.
It was the regular disjointed dream, mostly. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember lots of it. But in the end, I was at the Wagner Mall in Bend, but like it was when I was a kid. I was in a store that I think I owned, and my Mom was there and the kids. Maggie came in and was talking and piddling around doing stuff, but it was a sidebar to what was going on in the dream.</description>
